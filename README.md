# NLP_SMS_SPAM_Detection

- Completed NLP classification problem on SMS Spam dataset
- Used TF-IDF for feature extraction and Random Forest Algorithm for classification; precision for spam came to be 1.0 and recall 0.83
- Performed manual testing on string
- I repeated the same task in SMS_Spam_Updated.ipynb using different approaches and algorithms (Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB, Support Vector ) and analyzed the accuracy of each, ranging from 96 to 98%
